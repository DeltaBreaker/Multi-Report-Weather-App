# Multi-Report-Weather-App
This is a simple site that displays weather data for multiple locations across 5 days. The results will be displayed as one main section and 5 sub sections below that for subsequent days. It shows the city name, dates, weather state, temp, wind speed, and humidity. Cities searched will be displayed on the left with no repeating results and can be clicked to quickly load the weather data for that particular city. They will also persist across multiple visits for convenience.
